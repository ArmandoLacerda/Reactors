# Introduction to Bash

Bash is the standard shell scripting language for Linux. A shell is a program that commands the operating system to perform actions.  Shells like PowerShell and Bash give system administrators the power and precision they need for fine-tuned control of the computers they're responsible for. In this session we’ll cover commands such as ls, cat, and ps. Learn how to redirect input and output, how to find and terminate rogue processes and how to filter Azure CLI output. Once this session is over, you’ll feel more comfortable using a shell to automate your Linux tasks.
