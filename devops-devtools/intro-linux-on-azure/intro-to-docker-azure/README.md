A container is a loosely isolated environment that allows us to build and run software packages. These software packages include the code and all dependencies to run applications quickly and reliably on any computing environment. We call these packages container images. Docker is a containerization platform used to develop, ship, and run containers. In this session weâ€™ll cover the basics of Docker and how to Run Docker containers with Azure Container Instances
