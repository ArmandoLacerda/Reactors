# Introduction to automated deployments on Azure with Terraform

Hashicorp Terraform is an open-source tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure. It codifies infrastructure in configuration files that describe the topology of cloud resources. These resources include virtual machines, storage accounts, and networking interfaces. The Terraform CLI provides a simple mechanism to deploy and version the configuration files to Azure. In this session, weâ€™ll be configuring Terraform with the Azure CLI and covering the basics on how to use it to automate your Azure deployments.
