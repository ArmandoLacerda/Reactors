# Introduction to Azure Kubernetes Service


A container is an atomic unit of software that packages up code, dependencies, and configuration for a specific application. The process of deploying, updating, monitoring, and removing containers introduces many challenges. Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and the management of containerized workloads. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) manages your hosted Kubernetes environment and makes it simple to deploy and manage containerized applications in Azure. In this session weâ€™ll be covering the basics of Azure Kubernetes Service and deploy a containerized application on Azure Kubernetes Service.
