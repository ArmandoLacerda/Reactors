As a part of this, the Microsoft Reactor is running a whole load of IoT livestreams throughout July, covering everything from Learning IoT, to LoRa, different hardware, TinyML and AI on the edge.

> #JulyOT 2022 starts on the 1st July 2022! You can find out more at [aka.ms/JulyOT](https://aka.ms/JulyOT)

Check out the list of livestreams, and either register on Meetup, or join us for the livestream at the right time.

### Lesson 1 - Introduction to IoT

The term 'Internet of Things' was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 to refer to connecting the Internet to the physical world via sensors. Since then, the term has been used to describe any device that interacts with the physical world around it either by gathering data from sensors, or providing real-world interactions via actuators (devices that do something like turn on a switch or light an LED), generally connected to other devices or the Internet.
 
This lesson covers some of the introductory topics around the Internet of Things, and shows a basic ‚ÄòHello World‚Äô project with a microcontroller.

### Lesson 2 - a deeper dive into IoT

This lesson dives deeper into some of the concepts covered in the last lesson. The two components of an IoT application are the Internet and the thing, and this lesson dives deeper into both of these, covering different types of ‚Äòthings‚Äô, including microcontrollers and single-board computers. It then looks at the  different ways these ‚Äòthings‚Äô can use the Internet.

### Lesson 3 - Interact with the Physical World with Sensors and Actuators

This lesson introduces two of the important concepts for your IoT device - sensors and actuators. Sensors read data from the physical world, actuators control it, and this lesson looks in more depth at how this happens, covering analog and digital hardware (and what these terms mean). You will also see how to build a nightlight with a microcontroller, using sensor data to control an actuator.

### Lesson 4 - Connect your Device to the Internet

The I in IoT stands for Internet - the cloud connectivity and services that enable a lot of the features of IoT devices, from gathering measurements from the sensors connected to the device, to sending messages to control the actuators. IoT devices typically connect to a single cloud IoT service using a standard communication protocol, and that service is connected to the rest of your IoT application, from AI services to make smart decisions around your data, to web apps for control or reporting.
 
IoT devices can receive messages from the cloud. Often the messages contain commands - that is instructions to perform an action either internally (such as reboot or update firmware), or using an actuator (such as turning on a light).
 
This lesson introduces some of the communication protocols IoT devices can use to connect to the cloud, and the types of data they might send or receive. It will also show how to control a microcontroller over MQTT.

## Raspberry Pi and a reTerminal as an Azure IoT ‚òÅÔ∏è device

In these series we will show how to create a complete Azure IoT / Digital Twin solution using popular devices like a Raspberry Pi, SeeedStudio reTerminal and a real elevator. 

This series will cover the following sessions:

1. Let's setup a Raspberry Pi and a reTerminal as an Azure IoT ‚òÅÔ∏è device
1. Azure IoT Edge and Machine Learning üß† with Raspberry Pi and reTerminal 
1. Let's create a Digital Twin solution for our Azure IoT Elevator üõó

We will show the step-by-step process for each one of these scenarios. And, we'll share a few implementation options, so you can get some ideas and walk away with a plan to start creating your own Azure IoT solution.

Let's code this!

This series will be run twice - once in English, and once in Spanish.
