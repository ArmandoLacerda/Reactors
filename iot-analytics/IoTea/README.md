# IoTea: Brewing an Azure flavored Home Supply Chain

Large IoT applications can take many forms including smart buildings, digital agriculture or even smart cities, and implementing them can be daunting. Join Jim and Sam as they demystify some of this by overengineering a ‘simple’ home IoT project in these live coding sessions.

Sam loves tea and wants to ensure he always has enough, and Jim has some ideas on how he could use IoT to monitor how much tea Sam has left in his pantry. Rather than just wire up a simple sensor, our two intrepid coders will build out a smart supply chain taking advantage of Jim’s IoT knowledge, and Sam’s experience with supply chain. They will look at gathering data from sensors, sending it to the cloud, then analyzing tea usage over time to see when to order some more based off lead times for Sam’s 2 favorite suppliers. All this data is no good without dashboards, so they will dig into reporting tools to chart just how much tea Sam drinks every day and show it on dashboards that can be mounted in Sam’s pantry.

## Schedule

The IoTea series will be streamed to the [Microsoft Developer Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/MicrosoftDeveloper) and [Microsoft Reactor YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkm6luGCS3hD25jcEhvRMIA) channels.
