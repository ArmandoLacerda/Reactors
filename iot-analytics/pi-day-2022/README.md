# Pi Day 2022

3/14, or the 14th of March is [Pi day](https://www.piday.org) (apologies to everyone outside the US who uses DD/MM date formats...)!

The best thing to celebrate Pi day with is, well, Pie.

The second best thing to celebrate Pi day with is the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org), one of our favorite IoT devices.
