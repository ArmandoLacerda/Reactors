# Jim Learns Stuff - Hands on workshops

In this series of 2 workshops, Jim gets hands on discovering some cool new tech with some great workshops created by the Education Advocacy team at Microsoft. Join Jim, and either relax and enjoy watching, or fire up the workshop and code along!

## Build a diabetic retinopathy detector with Power Apps

Jim is a Type 1 diabetic, so he must consider multiple aspects of this health. One of which is his eyes. Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes, which might cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems at first. But it can lead to blindness. Careful management of diabetes is the best way to prevent vision loss.

Doctors detect this by dilating the patients' pupils and photographing their retina. This is a manual process but is one that can be automated with the help of AI image models!

In this hands-on workshop, Jim will build an app that can detect diabetic retinopathy, using Azure Custom Vision and Power Apps.

## Get started with Development Containers in VS Code

After over 23 years in the tech industry, Jim has started to get sick of setting up dev environments to work on projects, and he is not the only one! It is almost a rite of passage for new developers on a team to re-write the on-boarding guide (again) listing all the tools and configuration needed to get started developing on a project.

What if there was a better way? What if you could deploy a pre-configured machine and begin work with a single click? This is the power of containers and VS Code.

In this hands-on workshop, Jim will show how to access, customize, and add software to development containers in Visual Studio Code so that you can collaborate with ease across machines and development environments.

## Speaker

![A picture of Jim standing outside a building with his arms crossed looking very handsome in a shirt that says Puppies, Azure and I'm fine](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/jimbobbennett/raw/main/images/Headshot1-tiny-square.png)

Jim is a Regional Cloud Advocate focusing on building out and skilling communities in the Pacific North West, with a focus on the Microsoft Reactor in Redmond, Washington. Heâ€™s British, so sounds way smarter than he actually is, and is happy he moved to Redmond in time to be locked down at home and not see the office he came to work in, or the places he wanted to visit. In the past heâ€™s lived in 4 continents working as a developer in the mobile, desktop, and scientific space. He's spoken at conferences and events all around the globe, organised meetup groups and communities, and written a book on mobile development.

He also hates and is allergic to cats, but has a 9-year-old daughter who loves cats, so he has 2 cats.

You can find Jim on the following platforms:
