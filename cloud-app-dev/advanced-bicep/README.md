In this intermediate level series, we will explore using Bicep to deploy a more complex set of services in Azure. Services like Application Insights, Key Vault, and Azure Monitor can quickly increase the complexity of your deployment with added requirements. We will discuss design consideration for templates with multiple modules. We will share tips and tricks for developing your Bicep modules to be re-usable across multiple projects.
