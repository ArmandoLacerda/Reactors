March is our Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning month in the **Microsoft Reactor Network**. 

This is the perfect time to share developer experiences working with **Visual Studio Code** and **GitHub CoPilot**.

That‚Äôs why on March we will host 5 different 30-minutes sessions, with  experiences working with:

    - Python
    - C++
    - C#
    - Markdown
    - Using CoPilot to control a Roomba vacuum cleaner ü§ñ !

Happy coding!

## Sessions Description

    GitHub Copilot works with a broad set of frameworks and languages. Currently Copilot supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Java, and Go. However, I also used it with other languages like C++ and C#; and even while I‚Äôm writing documentation with MarkDown.
    I‚Äôm always in charge. Cycling through Copilot suggestions and manually editing the suggested code is an amazing flow. What I really like is that GitHub Copilot adapts to my own code style.
    During this series, we will review how Copilot works with Python, C++, C# and Markdown. We will also run Copilot in different coding environments like Visual Studio Code or GitHub Codespaces.
    At the end of the series, we will use Copilot suggestions to perform a cool activity: connect and control a Roomba Vacuum cleaner.
