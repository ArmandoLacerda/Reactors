Now powered by Power Platform !](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Toronto/events/283411334/)** <br><br>Winter is here and my backyard squirrels‚Äô friends still come every day to get some food, snow is not a problem for them. I created an Azure IoT solution that help me feed my squirrels (view that previous session on-demand in this [Microsoft Reactor YouTube video](https://youtu.be/hRvMbVoJlAs).<br>Now it's time to leverage the Power Platform - Power BI to analyze and visualize the data collected through Azure IoT. We will see how to use Power BI to get more insights on understating different animals eating behavioural patterns and highlight certain correlations using powerful visual analytics capabilities.<br><br>Presenters: **Ashraf Ghonaim (Microsoft MVP)** and **Bruno Capuano (Sr Cloud Advocate)** |  [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Toronto/events/283411334/)      | [Microsoft Reactor YouTube](https://aka.ms/FeedmySquirrels)

Mar 15 2022 | **[The future of Computing with Spatial Computing and Quantum Computing](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Toronto/events/283489759/)** <br><br>The next wave of digital disruption is Spatial Computing, an emerging technology that will change how we interact with computers and the physical world, using intelligent edge devices like a HoloLens and other mobile devices. Mainly driven by AI computer vision and advanced sensors, those devices can spatially sense the world around us and make the spatially aware context part of the experience. With technologies like the AR Cloud, a common spatial map can be shared between heterogeneous devices to build connected, collaborative, and cross-platform Metaverse apps where virtual objects anchored in the physical world can be shared across devices and over time with persistence.<br>During the Spatial Computing era we will also enter the Quantum Computing age. Quantum Computers are still in its infancy with limited Qubits, but Q-Day is coming, the day when Quantum Advantage will be readily available and deprecating today‚Äôs cryptography. Even with the hardware infancy, Quantum-inspired computing (QIC) already provides significant advantages for things like Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QIO).<br>In this session Rene will explain the concepts and technologies supporting these transformative computing paradigm changes and will show applied and practical use cases to make these abstracts concepts more feasible.<br><br>Presenters **Ren√© Schulte is Director of Global Innovation at Valorem Reply, Microsoft RD and Microsoft MVP**  |  [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Toronto/events/283489759/)      | [Microsoft Reactor YouTube](https://aka.ms/Mar15ThefutureofComputing)
Mar 15 2022 | **[The Sustainability Super-power: AI](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Toronto/events/284158107/)** <br><br>This session builds upon the ‚ÄòPushing the boundaries of leadership with Sustainability AI‚Äô session and takes a deeper look at developing AI solutions, assessing, and evaluating the environmental cost of doing so from the perspective of Green Software Engineering Principles. Where costs of development are high not only in terms of time to build expertise but also in compute costs, open-source climate AI models are a great starting point, which can be compared in terms of performance from a variety of angles.<br><br>Presenters **Darshna Shah is the Director of Innovation at Sustainability Studio (part of the Elastacloud Group) and Microsoft AI MVP**|  [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Toronto/events/284158107/)      | [Microsoft Reactor YouTube](https://aka.ms/SustainabilityinAI)
Mar 17 2022 | **[Bot Composer: a new way of creating smart bots](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Toronto/events/283893922/)** <br><br>Nowadays, bots are getting more and more advanced. They look nothing like a pop-up window with just a list of options we used to see before. Microsoft offers many tools to make your bot as practical and adjustable as possible: Cognitive Services, Bot Framework, cloud databases, etc. Microsoft Bot Composer allows developers to have everything they need to create a brilliant and platform-independent bot right from the tool. In this session, you'll learn about bot design and development tricks, tools and services to make your bot user appealing, connecting bots to different environments. You'll see how to start developing a completely custom bot right from the Composer. This session will bring enough inspiration to start using Bot Composer, whether you are a seasoned developer or only starting your journey.<br><br>Presenters **Veronika Kolesnikova (Senior Software Engineer, Microsoft MVP (AI))** |  [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-Toronto/events/283893922/)      | [Microsoft Reactor YouTube](https://aka.ms/Mar17BotComposer)
