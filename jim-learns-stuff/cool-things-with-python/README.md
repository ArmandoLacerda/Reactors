# Jim Learns Stuff - cool things with Python üêç

Python is one of the top programming languages in the world, topping the TIOBE index and coming second in the GitHub state of the Octoverse report.

Python is a very versatile language, used for everything from teaching young kids to code, to building complex ML and AI models. It‚Äôs used by web developers, micro-service developers, infrastructure engineers, and data scientists. 
 
In this series of Jim Learns Stuff, Jim will be playing with some cool things with Python (some very hot of the presses), including re-creating classic cryptography from the ancient world, and embedding Python in a web page!

### Episode 1 - Ancient cryptography

Did you know some of the earliest documented cryptography was used for lovers to exchange love notes nearly 2,500 years ago? Or that techniques to break cryptography trace their origins to 1,500 years ago? 
 
In this episode, Jim explores some classic cryptography and builds out tools in Python to not only encrypt messages, but also to try to decrypt them! he‚Äôll be travelling around the ancient world from India, to Rome, Sparta and Baghdad, learning about their techniques for encrypting and decrypting all manner of secrets. 

### Episode 2 - Python in the browser

We all know to do web things in a browser you need JavaScript, right? That‚Äôs the only programming language you can mix in with HTML and have it work? Right? Right? 
 
Wrong! How about Python inline in your HTML? Yes, this is now a thing thanks to [PyScript](https://pyscript.net), recently announced at PyCon US. PyScript uses a version of Python running under Web Assembly to allow you to use in-line Python, accessing all the normal Python packages you know and love. 
 
In this episode, Jim learns all about PyScript, putting the early alpha versions through their paces to build out a simple web app. He‚Äôll be seeing if he can do web development without JavaScript.

### Jim Bennett

![A picture of Jim standing outside a building with his arms crossed looking very handsome in a shirt that says Puppies, Azure and I'm fine](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/jimbobbennett/raw/main/images/Headshot1-tiny-square.png)

Jim is a Regional Cloud Advocate focusing on building out and skilling communities in the Pacific North West, with a focus on the Microsoft Reactor in Redmond, Washington. He‚Äôs British, so sounds way smarter than he actually is, and is happy he moved to Redmond in time to be locked down at home and not see the office he came to work in, or the places he wanted to visit. In the past he‚Äôs lived in 4 continents working as a developer in the mobile, desktop, and scientific space. He's spoken at conferences and events all around the globe, organised meetup groups and communities, and written a book on mobile development.

He also hates and is allergic to cats, but has a 9-year-old daughter who loves cats, so he has 2 cats.

You can find Jim on the following platforms:
