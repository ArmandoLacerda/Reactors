The increased demand for custom software solutions in support of digital transformation has sparked the emergence of citizen developers outside of IT, which has influenced the rise in low-code / no-code development platforms.

In this mini-conference, we will focus on a low-code development platform? Benefits / limitation of low - code / no-code developer platform? Difference between low-code & no-code? What can you build with low-code platforms? When to go for it? We will learn - Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Virtual Agents, Power FX and we will also cover how to build low code apps with Microsoft Azure.
